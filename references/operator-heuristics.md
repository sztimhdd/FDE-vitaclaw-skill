# Operator Heuristics

## Mission Qualification

- Prefer workflows with recurring pain, not ceremonial pain.
- Prefer loops with a named operator and a measurable failure cost.
- Reject "knowledge assistant" asks when there is no decision or action downstream.

## Reality Capture

- Ask for one clean example and one ugly example.
- Trace where responsibility moves, not just where data moves.
- Look for shadow tools: spreadsheets, chat groups, photos, screenshots, handwritten notes.
- Capture exception handling. That is often where the real system lives.

## System Framing

- If the ask is broad, separate sensing, judgment, routing, execution, and verification.
- Choose one bottleneck to fix first.
- Make non-goals explicit early to avoid political scope inflation.

## Ontology & Action Model

- If an object has no action or state consequence, it may not belong in the first ontology.
- If an action changes the world, specify authority, evidence, and rollback.
- Distinguish advisory outputs from state-changing actions.

## Intervention Design

- Use AI for ambiguity reduction before you use it for autonomy.
- Keep the pilot on the narrowest loop that can show time, quality, or risk improvement.
- A credible pilot has a fallback path that still works on a bad model day.

## Delivery Architecture

- Read-only pilots are easier to launch but often weaker at proving value.
- Write-back without audit is a governance hazard.
- The best operator interface is usually the one people already live in.

## Expansion Logic

- Scale only after one loop is trusted, measured, and owned.
- Expansion by adjacent loop is usually safer than expansion by bigger customer promise.
- If each new site needs heroics, you do not have a program yet.
